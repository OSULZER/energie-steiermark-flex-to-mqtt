# Energie Steiermark Flex Tarif Home Assistant Price

Since there is no API from the looks of it i creted  simple Python script that crawls e-steiermark.com to extract the current price per kWh for the Flex tarif and sends the data to a given MQTT server. I also added sample configurations for a possible home assistant integration.
